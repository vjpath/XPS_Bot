Game Test Automation

Q3 Technologies developed a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solution to automate the testing
and Quality Checks of the games; for a leading manufacturer of Gaming machines.

The solution was designed to minimize the human intervention and thus the human dependency
from updating the existing games to the launching of the newly introduced games. The solution
also helped the Client to raise the gaming quality standards and enabled to make a faster move
to the new markets by fastening the launch of new games.

Client Background

The Client is one of the largest manufacturers of slot machine games in the world.

Having the pride of being one of the largest gambling machine manufacturers, the Client is
licensed in around 300 gaming jurisdictions and operates in over 90 countries.

Success Story

Business Use-Case

The Client is truly a powerhouse in the gaming industry and hence, the quality of games is of
utmost importance. The biggest challenge that was coming into the pace of the Client was

 Time to Market – The Client produces and releases several hundred games per month.
These games need to be tested thoroughly before being released to the market. Due to
higher dependency on human intervention in quality checks of the games, the cycle times
were very high.

 Improvement in the Quality standards of the games – Human intervention was more
prone to errors as there are numbers and calculations for wins and losses. Moreover,
these numbers need to be run for millions of cycles.

The Solution: Proposed & Implemented

The Client was looking for a solution which could help them in overcoming
the challenges faced in manual testing of the games and hence can help
in making a faster move to the new markets. Since the human
intervention was a major cause of the challenge faced, the Client wanted
a solution which could eradicate the business problem completely.

Q3 proposed Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to be a potential solution
and automated the Quality Testing process of the games. Some of the
major identified test-cases were:

 Game Rules & Bet Changes Validation

 Games Execution Validation (as per the defined logic)

 Denomination Change Validation and Verifying the gaming

behaviour

 Audit Mode Functioning Validation

 Rewards, Jackpots & Milestone scenarios Validation
